# The Non-Tyrannical Alternative; A Refutation of IOG's Proposed Decentralized Governance Model
"It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong" 
-Voltaire

## Abstract
We refute the deeply flawed [CIP-1694](https://github.com/JaredCorduan/CIPs/edit/voltaire-v1/CIP-1694/README.md) proposed by Input Output Global for an on-chain governance system and propose an alternative, more decentralized system of governance.
